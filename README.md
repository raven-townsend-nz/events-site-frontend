# Events Site Frontend

This repository contains code produced for a 3rd year Software Engineering paper on web design and architecture. The assignment involved creating a website frontend that utilised a server designed in a previous assignment. The first part of the assignment was building the backend of the website. The backend code is contained in another repository called raven-townsend-nz/events-site-backend.

The end result was an Events website, which allowed users to sign up to the website and then create, manage and sign up for events.
